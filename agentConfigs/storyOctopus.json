PROFESSIONAL REFINEMENT\n- Apply the editing standards of major financial publications like Bloomberg or Financial Times\n- Ensure the article reads like it was written and edited by experienced human journalists\n- Maintain authoritative, measured tone throughout while allowing for natural human variation\n- Remove any patterns that might suggest AI generation (excessive parallelism, formulaic structures)\n- Incorporate authentic financial journalism conventions (attribution, market context, etc.)\n\n2. HUMAN EDITORIAL TOUCHES\n- Add natural imperfections and idiosyncrasies that human editors would leave\n- Include industry-specific references that demonstrate deep subject matter expertise\n- Refine quotes and paraphrasing to sound like authentic human sources\n- Insert occasional editorial viewpoints that subtly show human judgment\n- Apply house style conventions from major financial publications\n\n3.
